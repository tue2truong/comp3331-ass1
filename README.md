# Simple Transport Protocol(STP) 

A piece of software that consists of sender and receiver component that allows reliable unidirectional data transfer. 
* To ensure reliability, STP includes some of the features of TCP protocol: 
	* Three-way handshake (SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK) 
	* Four segment connection termination (FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK)
	* Sequece number
	* Culmulative Acknowledgement 
	* Time out operation 
	* Buffers 

In this project, STP will transfer simple text ASCII files from the sender to the receiver.
